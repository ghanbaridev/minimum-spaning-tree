# minimum-spaning-tree
shortest way In this program, we are trying to find the Minimum Spanning Tree in an undirected graph using the Python language and the famous Kruskal and Dijkstra and Prime algorithms in computer science. In this program, first, the desired graph is taken from the user and the algorithms are executed on it. In this program, there are three classes, in each class, the algorithm in question runs on it. The first class is related to Kruskal's algorithm, the second class is related to Prime's algorithm, and the third class is related to Dijkstra's algorithm.
